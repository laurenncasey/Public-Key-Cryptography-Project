# Public Key Cryptography Project
This project was developed for the Abstract Algebra course at UW-Eau Claire (2022) and focuses on explaining the concepts of Public Key Cryptography in a clear and accessible way. The project includes a website and a Jupyter notebook that provide detailed explanations, examples, and proofs.

Project Files:
main.html:
A Wiki-style webpage that provides a comprehensive introduction to Public Key Cryptography. The page is designed to cater to different learning styles and includes:

Clear Explanations: Step-by-step breakdowns of the key concepts involved in public key cryptography.
Example Problems: Practical examples to illustrate how public key cryptography works in real-world scenarios.
Proofs: Mathematical proofs demonstrating the principles behind public key cryptography.
Multiple Learning Styles: Content presented through both text and visual aids to enhance understanding.
publicKeyCryptoExample.ipynb:
A Jupyter Notebook that presents an easy-to-follow example of Public Key Cryptography in action. This file is designed to help learners grasp the technical aspects of the topic through code demonstrations and real-life applications.

Learning Objectives:
Understand the basics of Public Key Cryptography.
Explore the mathematical foundations of cryptographic algorithms.
Gain insight into how public and private keys are used in secure communication.
Work through practical examples and proofs that solidify the theoretical concepts.
This project combines theoretical explanations with interactive elements to create a well-rounded learning experience for students of Abstract Algebra and anyone interested in cryptography.
